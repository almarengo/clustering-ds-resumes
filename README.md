# Unsupervised Learning - Clustering with Data Scientist Salary dataset

![](images/clustering.jpg)


## Abstract: 

In this notebook, we will work with unsupervised learning methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. We will also see how to reduce the dimensionality of the original data and what the main approaches are for grouping similar data points.

We are going to do some anaylisis on the Data Scientist Salry dataset found on Kaggle. Link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilbhathi/data-scientist-salary-us-glassdoor).

We are also going to review pipelines and column transformers. If you are interestd on more, check my other project [Marketing Campaign Analysis](https://github.com/almarengo/marketing_campaign_analysis), in particular notebook 4.

This project will include the following:

- EDA and Data Preprocesing
- Feature Engineering
- PCA and Data Visualization
- Pipelines and Column Transformers
- Model evaluation and metrics
- Recommendations
